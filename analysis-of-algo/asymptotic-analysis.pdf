Need for performance Analysis :
To achieve  user friendliness, modularity, security, maintainability, speed etc performance should be taken care of. Performance of a program is directly proportional to scale. 

Asymptotic analysis : it is analysis of behaviour of a function when it is about to approach infinity or a defined limit value, this can be considered as determining limiting behaviour of a function. 
Asymptotic analysis in algorithms : 
In algorithms asymptotic analysis is done by evaluating input size vs the size/time taken by the algorithm to run. The idea of asymptotic analysis of algorithm is measure of efficiency of a algorithm which is independent of machine performance. 
We can have three cases to analyze an algorithm:
- Worst Case
- Average Case
- Best Case

Worst Case :  In worst case the complexity of algorithm is calculated using upper bound, the constraint which will cause maximum number of operations execution need. 
For eg : a array of “n” elements needs O(n) time complexity because it has to process total n elements. 

Average Case : This case depends on the discrete uniform distribution which is a symmetric probability distribution according to which if there are total n number of values, every value has 1/n probability of occurrence and each value is equally likely to be observed. In this case we must know or predict the mathematical distribution of all inputs.
For eg : In average case if there is a array of size n we will calculate computing time for all n inputs followed by division with sum of total number of input. 

Best Case: Complexity of algorithm in Best case is calculated using the lower bound.
We need to find the case in which minimum number of operations has to be executed. 
For eg : while doing linear search we find the element on the first position. 


ASYMPTOTIC NOTATIONS
Asymptotic notations are mathematical tools for representing time complexity of algorithms according to asymptotic analysis. 
Following are three notations mostly used to represent time complexity of algorithms: 
Θ Notation
Big O Notation
 Ω Notation
Θ Notation : theta notation bounds the function from above and lower bounds.
Big O Notation: it bounds function only from upper boundary.
Ω Notation:  it bounds function only from lower bounds.
